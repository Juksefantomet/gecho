# Gecho

> *"Time is the most valuable commodity."* ‚Äî Gordon Gekko

**Gecho** is a Rails-inspired scaffolding and migrations CLI toolset for Go projects using:

- [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)


It helps you bootstrap new apps with more haste by generating templates for models, routes, queries, migrations, and project structure in seconds.

Disclaimer: This is probably highly opinionated and might not match your expectations on how to structure your project, but it might get you started if you don't have one already.

## üì¶ Installation

Install the CLI globally with:

```bash
go install github.com/Juksefantomet/gecho@latest
```

Install tag specific version:

```bash
go install github.com/Juksefantomet/gecho@v0.1.3
```

---

## üöÄ Commands

### `gecho init`

Creates a Gecho-compatible folder structure.

If no `go.mod` exists, you will be prompted to enter a module name.

It also generates:
- `.env` file (PostgreSQL connection)
- `main.go` with Echo + Swagger boilerplate
- `app/routes/helloWorld.go`
- `app/services/database/database.go`

```bash
gecho init
```

---

### `gecho scaffold <name>`

Generates:
- Model: `app/models/<name>.go`
- Route: `app/routes/<name>s.go`
- Query: `app/services/database/<name>Queries.go`
- Migrations: `db/migrations/*.up.sql` + `.down.sql`

Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: You must wire the route manually in `main.go`. There is a commented example present in the generated main.go

```bash
gecho scaffold user
```

---

### `gecho create-migration <name>`

Creates a pair of empty `.up.sql` and `.down.sql` migration files.

```bash
gecho create-migration add_index_to_users
```

---

### `gecho migrate [down]`

Applies or rolls back migrations defined in `db/migrations`.

```bash
gecho migrate         # applies all .up.sql files
gecho migrate down    # rolls back the last applied migration in migrations table in the database
```

---

## üß™ After `gecho init`

Run this to get everything working: (first time users of swagger must install the binary)

```bash
go mod tidy
go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@v1.16.4
swag init
go run main.go
```

NOTE:
Installing swag@latest can cause issue when running go run main.go - lock in on version


Then visit:

```
http://localhost:3000/swagger/index.html
```

---

## üîñ Releasing

Releases are based on the version in the `VERSION` file (e.g., `0.1.0`).

To tag and push a release:

```bash
./release.sh
```

Then draft a GitHub release at:

```
https://github.com/Juksefantomet/gecho/releases/new?tag=v0.1.0
```

Gecho was built with speed, repetition, and scale in mind.
